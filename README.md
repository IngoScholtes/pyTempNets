# Introduction

`pyTempNet` is a python module for the analysis of time-stamped relational data. It particularly facilitates the analysis of **temporal networks** from the perspective of **higher-order networks**, a powerful framework which has been introduced in the following recent articles and which allows to overcome some of the limitations of common network-analytic methods:

**Note:** The development of `pyTempNets` continues in the new python module [`pathpy`](https://github.com/IngoScholtes/pathpy). This new package unifies the analysis of temporal networks and pathways, and provides principled model selection techniques to determine the optimal order of higher-order network representations. Switching to `pathpy` is thus strongly suggested.

The module is written in pure python, has no platform-specific dependencies and should thus work on all platforms. The latest development version can be installed by typing:

`> pip install git+git://github.com/IngoScholtes/pyTempNets.git`

While the current master branch only allows to generate second-order networks, the [development branch](https://github.com/IngoScholtes/pyTempNets/tree/korder) can be used to analyze **higher-order networks with arbitrary order** as introduced in our works. Please stay tuned for our forthcoming stable release that will include many more feartures. 

## Tutorial
