# Introduction

`pyTempNet` is a python module for the analysis of time-stamped relational data. It particularly facilitates the analysis of **temporal networks** from the perspective of **higher-order networks**, a powerful framework which has been introduced in the following recent articles and which allows to overcome some of the limitations of common network-analytic methods:

The module is written in pure python, has no platform-specific dependencies and should thus work on all platforms. The latest development version can be installed by typing: 

`> pip install git+git://github.com/IngoScholtes/pyTempNets.git`

## Tutorial

A detailed educational tutorial showcasing the features of `pyTempNet` and illustrating its theoretical foundation is [available online](https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/people/ischoltes/research-insights/temporal-networks-demo/).
